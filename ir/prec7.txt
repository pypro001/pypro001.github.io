Nltk 
NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum. 
Punkt 
This tokenizer divides a text into a list of sentences by using an unsupervised algorithm to build a model for abbreviation words, collocations, and words that start sentences. It must be trained on a large collection of plaintexts in the target language before it can be used
 STEPS :-
1) Write a command to install nltk in cmd.

2) Then in python interpreter write down the following commands :
 >>>import nltk 
>>>nltk.download (‘stopwords’) 
>>>nltk.download (‘punkt’) 
>>>from nltk.corpus import stopwords 
>>>print(stopwords.words(‘english’))


3) Program for Stop word Removal from a Text 
Source code:
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
example_sent="this is a sample sentence,showing off the stop words filteration"
stop_words=set(stopwords.words('english'))
word_tokens=word_tokenize(example_sent)
filtered_sentence=[]
for w in word_tokens:
    if w not in stop_words:
        filtered_sentence.append(w)
print(word_tokens)
print(filtered_sentence)
