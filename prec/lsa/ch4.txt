       SSH History
SSH was created by Tatu Ylönen in 1995. The protocol was designed to prevent password-sniffing attacks at the Helsinki University of Technology. The first version of the protocol, now called 
SSH-1, was designed to replace unsecured protocols such as rsh, rlogin, and Telnet. It started as 
freeware but soon became proprietary software.

After Ylönen's SSH-1 became a popular tool worldwide, the Internet Engineering Task Force 
(IETF) assembled a group whose purpose was to develop a successor to the protocol. In 2006, SSH2 became a new standard, featuring security improvements such as Diffie-Helman key exchange.

What Does SSH Mean?
The acronym SSH stands for "Secure Shell." The SSH protocol was designed as a secure alternative 
to unsecured remote shell protocols. It utilizes a client-server paradigm, in which clients and servers 
communicate via a secure channel.
