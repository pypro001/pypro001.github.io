MySQL is an open-source cross-platform relational database management system (RDBMS). 
MySQL uses the Standard Query Language (SQL) to communicate with the MySQL 
software. 

Database admins and developers interact with RDBMS by running statements, which are 
referred to as queries in database management. In this tutorial, you will learn how you can 
run queries on your Linux terminal with MySQL. 

Databases are used to store organized data and information. In a database, related items are 
stored in a table. These tables, in turn, contain columns that store data entries of a particular 
type, each of which has a corresponding row.
