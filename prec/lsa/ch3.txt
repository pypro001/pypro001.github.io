       ||Configure NTP Server (NTPd), Install and Configure NTPd||
       The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol used to synchronize computer system clock 
automatically over a networks. The machine can have the system clock use Coordinated 
Universal Time (UTC) rather than local time.

Maintaining accurate time on Linux systems especially servers is a important task for many 
reasons. For example, in a networked environment, accurate timekeeping is required for accurate
timestamps in packets and system logs for root-cause analysis, determining when problems 
occurred, and finding correlations.

Chrony is now the default NTP implementation package on the latest versions of Linux operating 
systems such as CentOS, RHEL, Fedora and Ubuntu/Debian among others and comes preinstalled by default. The package consists of chronyd, a daemon that runs in userspace, and 
chronyc a command-line program for monitoring and controlling chronyd

       Step:-
1.	Update and Upgrade System 
$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
2. Install NTP $ sudo apt install ntp

	
3. Open ntpd configuration file $ sudo nano /etc/ntp.conf
4. Remove the pool and replace it with server in conf file
5. Restarting the NTP Service. $ sudo service ntp restart 
6. To Check the status of service. $ sudo service ntp status
7. Check the current ntp server. $ ntpq -p
