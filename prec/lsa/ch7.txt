The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open, cross-platform software 
protocol used for authentication and communication in directory services. LDAP provides the 
language that applications use to communicate with each other in directory services, which 
store computer accounts, users, and passwords and share them with other entities on 
networks. This allows applications and users to find and verify the information they need 
from across their organization.

LDAP has a wide range of uses, but the most popular is as a central hub for organizations to 
manage authentication. It is very effective for helping organizations store, manage, and 
access usernames and passwords across their networks and applications. If organizations use 
the right plugins, LDAP enables them to store and verify credentials every time a user 
attempts to access applications, directories, and systems.

LDAP credentials do not only involve the standard username and password combinations. 
The protocol can also be used to manage other organizational attributes—such as storing 
addresses, structural data, and telephone numbers—which makes it crucial to managing and 
protecting user identities. LDAP also connects users with information on devices attached to 
a network, such as files, printers, and shared resources.
