       BIND or BIND 9 is an open source implementation of DNS, available for almost all Linux distributions. BIND stands Berkeley Internet Name Domain & it allows us to publish DNS information 
on internet as well as allows us to resolve DNS queries for the users. BIND is by far the most used 
DNS software on Internet.

The Domain Name System (DNS) turns domain names into IP addresses, which browsers use to 
load internet pages. Every device connected to the internet has its own IP address, which is used by 
other devices to locate the device. DNS servers make it possible for people to input normal words 
into their browsers, such as Fortinet.com, without having to keep track of the IP address for every 
website.
Set up authoritative DNS server on Ubuntu 18.04 with BIND9
