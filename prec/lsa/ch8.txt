       || Configure NIS Server ||

framework to NIS, however, all the orders capacities actually start with “yp”.

called maps, among an assortment of mainframes (ace and slaves). The administrator can 
refresh those information bases from a brought together area in a programmed and solid design 
to guarantee that all customers share a similar naming service information predictably all 
through the network. NIS was grown freely of DNS and has a marginally extraordinary core 
interest
