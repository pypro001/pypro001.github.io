Aim: To study and implementation of Infrastructure as a Service
1. Objectives: From this experiment, the student will be able to,
 Understand concepts of virtualization and to use cloud as Infrastructure as a
services.
 Learn the technique and its complexity
 Understand the importance of this technique from application point of view
2. Outcomes: The learner will be able,
 To match the industry requirements in the domains of Database management,
Programming and Networking with limited infrastructure.
 To analyze the local and global impact of computing on individuals,
organizations, and society.
 To use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practice.
3. Hardware / Software Required: Ubuntu operating system, Virtual machine,
WAMP/ZAMP server, Any tool or technology can be used for implementation of web
application e.g., JAVA, PHP, etc.
4. Theory:
5. Procedure:
Installation Steps: (https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/guides/single-machine.html)
Add user
useradd -s /bin/bash -d /opt/stack -m stack
apt-get install sudo -y
echo "stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
login as stack user
Download DevStack
sudo apt-get install git -y || sudo yum install -y git
git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-dev/devstack
cd devstack
Run DevStack
Now to configure stack.sh. DevStack includes a sample in devstack/samples/local.conf.
Create local.conf as shown below to do the following:
 Set FLOATING_RANGE to a range not used on the local network, i.e.
192.168.1.224/27. This configures IP addresses ending in 225-254 to be used as
floating IPs.
 Set FIXED_RANGE and FIXED_NETWORK_SIZE to configure the internal
address space used by the instances.
 Set FLAT_INTERFACE to the Ethernet interface that connects the host to your
local network. This is the interface that should be configured with the static IP address
mentioned above.
 Set the administrative password. This password is used for
the admin and demo accounts set up as OpenStack users.
 Set the MySQL administrative password. The default here is a random hex string
which is inconvenient if you need to look at the database directly for anything.
 Set the RabbitMQ password.
 Set the service password. This is used by the OpenStack services (Nova, Glance, etc)
to authenticate with Keystone.
local.conf should look something like this:
[[local|localrc]]
FLOATING_RANGE=192.168.1.224/27
FIXED_RANGE=10.11.12.0/24
FIXED_NETWORK_SIZE=256
FLAT_INTERFACE=eth0
ADMIN_PASSWORD=supersecret
DATABASE_PASSWORD=iheartdatabases
RABBIT_PASSWORD=flopsymopsy
Run DevStack:
SERVICE_PASSWORD=iheartksl
./stack.sh
A seemingly endless stream of activity ensues. When complete you will see a summary
of stack.sh’s work, including the relevant URLs, accounts and passwords to poke at your
shiny new OpenStack.
Using OpenStack
At this point you should be able to access the dashboard from other computers on the local
network. In this example that would be http://192.168.43.29/ for the dashboard (aka
Horizon). Launch VMs and if you give them floating IPs and security group access those
VMs will be accessible from other machines on your network
